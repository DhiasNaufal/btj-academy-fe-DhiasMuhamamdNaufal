            recent graduate in Information Engineering, committed to continuous
            learning and eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. I
            am highly interested in the field of Software Engineering, such as
            designing applications and solving problems that arise within
            software systems. A curious thinker who's ambitious, loves learning,
            doesn't give up easily, and enjoys solving problems. I thrive in
            both team-oriented environments, where collaboration fosters
            innovation, and when working independently to tackle complex
            problems.
