          recent graduate in Information Engineering, committed to continuous
          learning and eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. I
          am highly interested in the field of Software Engineering, such as
          designing applications and solving problems that arise within software
          systems. A curious thinker who's ambitious, loves learning, doesn't
          give up easily, and enjoys solving problems. I thrive in both
          team-oriented environments, where collaboration fosters innovation,
          and when working independently to tackle complex problems.
